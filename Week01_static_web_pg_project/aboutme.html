         <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>I got my first degree AAS in computer science at Normandale college in Blommington, Minnesota in 2015 May.
            And then on the same year, septemeber 2015 i transferred to University of minnesota to get Bachilours degree 
            and i recieved Bs in computer science there in December 2017. Technicaly, i graduated in september 2017 
            but my expected graduation time was may December 2017 so i just decided to extend my graduation time and took 
            two very important Grad level classes, intercative web developement in react and react native and spatial database 
            management sysetm.

  <p>I was born and grew up in in Ethiopia. My parents were farmers and they use to live 
      about 30 miles away from the city called Bahir Dar in Northern Ethiopia.Though it does 
      not seem to far, it is actually far when there is no tarnasposrtation and when you have to
      walk on bare foot. But i was lucky that my parents moved close to the city when i was 3.
      </p>
      <p>
      That is how i got the chance to go to school. I was also 7 or 8 years old when i start
      school. Since then nothing makes me happy as learning science. Spatially i was very 
      interested in math, physics and biology and i was one of the top 5 students in the city until
      I finish high school. And then i started thinking that i should go to a different world 
      to learn more.

     I applied for a US permanent resident lotery in 2008 and won the 2009 DV lotery.
      June 14 2009 was my first day here in the US and i had to work about 3 years 
      before start school. And then i started school on spring 2013. I got My first AAS degree in computer science
      at normandale college in 2015 and my second degree, BS in computer science at the 
      University of Minnesota in Dec 2017.

        I enjoy the simple things in life. Being happy is a state of mind, 
        and I don't think people should settle for less than they deserve. 
        I always look toward the next best thing. I like seeing other people happy.
        When someone else is down, it breaks my heart. I've been through more than most 
        people my age, but hey, it's what has made me stronger. Life has thrown me 
        challenges, and so far, I've come out on top. I realized who my real friends are,
        and that my family always comes first.always. Photography is a passion of mine.
        I love music and movies. Heroes and Chuck are my favorite TV shows, so that means 
        Monday nights I'm unavailable! I'm average, and that's okay. I'm not one of those 
        girls that you turn your head toward when I walk down the street, and that's okay 
        too. There is more to life than beauty on the outside. It's about what's on the 
        inside. That's what really counts.
