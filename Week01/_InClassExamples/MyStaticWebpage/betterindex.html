            Bootstrap is a CSS and JS library that has a ton of predefined files for
            formatting websites in a mobile friendly way. One of the main goals of bootstrap
            is to make your website handle mobile users without causing the format of your
            site to go chaotic.
        
            CONTAINERS
            All boostrap elements typically are made to be inside of containers. The container class simply formats the content
            to be able to handle dynamic screen sizes. As well as force the contents to more aesthetically fit with the window
            size.

            There are 2 types of containers
                "container" which centers container content and provides margin spacing on the edges
                "container-fluid" which uses more real estate

            NOTE: You can not have a container within a container
