    <!-- Containers
            All boostrap elements typically are made to be inside of containers.
            The container class simply formats the content to be able to handle dynamic
            screen sizes, as well as force the contents to more aesthetically
            fit with the window size. 
        
            A container is, like the name suggests, a css class to encapsulate and format
            a section of the page. 
            
            There are two types of containers:
                - "container" -> centers the container content more towards the middle,
                    providing more padding on the sides
                - "container-fluid"-> uses more real estate than the normal container 
            
            Note: you cannot have a container within a container -->

                        it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
