    <!-- BOOTSTRAP 
            Bootstrap is a css and javascript library that has a ton of predefined files
        for formatting websites in a mobile friendly way. One of the main goals of 
        bootstrap is to make your website handle mobile users without causing the format
        of your website to go chaotic.-->

    <!-- Containers 
            -All bootstrap elements typically are made to be inside of
            containers. The container class simply formats the content to be able
            to handle dynamic screen sizes. As well as force the contents to more 
            aesthetically fit with the window size.-->

        Container
        -Container is, like the name suggests, a css class to 
        encapsualte and format a section of the page.
        -There are 2 types of containers.
        -"container"-> which centers the container content more
        towards the middle, providing more padding on the sides.
        -"container-fluid", which uses more real estate that the
        normal container.
        NOTE: You can NOT have containers in containers.

                        it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                        release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established
                        fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
                        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed
                        to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
                        packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
                        ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
                        years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
