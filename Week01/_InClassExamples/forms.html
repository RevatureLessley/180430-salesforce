        <h1>FORMS</h1>
        <p>Forms are elements that are used to collect user 
            input from the website and send it to a server.
            Input is typically gathered from the &lt;input&gt;
            Note in order to use reserved characters such as &lt;, you
            have to use entity references.  Which typically references
            the specific character in between a &amp; and &semi; symbol.
        </p>
