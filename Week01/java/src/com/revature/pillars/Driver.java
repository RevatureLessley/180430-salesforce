 * 
 * Pillars of OOP
 * - Abstraction
 * 	- hiding code complexity, car example; we push gas it goes don't need to know anything else
 * 	- abstract duplicate code removing redundant code
 * 	- Offer only the needed functionality of use
 * - Encapsulation
 * 	- data hiding 
 * 	- restricting access to data of object
 * 	- hides internal module data
 * - Inheritance
 * 	- inheriting fields and methods from a parent (super class),
 * 		allow for altering inherited traits and adding new ones, 
 * 		just like real life. 
 * - Polymorphism
 * 	- It offers multiple forms of components
 * 	- done via method overloading, and overriding
 * 	- Support for co variance <----- check this out
 * 	-
