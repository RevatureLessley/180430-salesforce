                Bootstrap is a css and javascript library that has a ton of predefined files
            for formatting websites in a mobile friendly way. One of the main goals 
            of bootstrap is to make your website handle mobile users without causing the format
            of your website to go chaotic. -->

                -All boostrap elements typically are made to be inside of
                continers. The container class simply formats the content to be able
                to handle dynamic screen sizes. As well as force the contents to more
                aesthetically fit with the window size. -->
            <!-- Container
                -container is, like the name suggests, a css class to 
                encapsulate and format a section of the apge.
                -There are two types of containers. 
                -"Container" -> which centers the container content moe
                towards the middle, providing more padding on the sides.
                "Container-Fluid" -> which uses more real estate than the normal container.
                Note: You can NOT have containers in containers.
