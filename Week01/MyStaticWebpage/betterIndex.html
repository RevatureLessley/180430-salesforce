    <!-- BOOTSTRAP
            Bootstrap is a CSS and JS library that has many predefined files for formatting websites in a mobile-friendly
            way. One of the main goals of bootstrap is to make your website mobile users without causing the format of your 
            website to go chaotic. -->
    <!-- Containters
            All bootstrap elements typically are made to be inside of containers.
            The containter class simply formats the content to be able to handle dynamic screen sizes
            as well as force the content to more aesthetically fit with window size.
            Containter is like the name suggests, a CSS class to ecapsulate and format a section of the page.
            There are 2 types of containers.
            "Container" which centers the container more towards the middle
            "containe-fluid which uses more real estate than the normal container
            You cannot have containers within containers-->

                        text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
                        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
