Closures
--------
Encapsulation is essentially data hiding (but you remember that, don't you? :P)

function foo() {
  var x = 5;
  var y = 10;
  return function() {
    getX = function() {
      return x; 
    }
  }
}

Call-back functions
-------------------
- A function (A) takes a function definition (B) as input.
- A performs an anction that takes a variable that takes a variable amount of time to complete (1 second-30 gigayears)
- The user's system is not locked waiting for it to complete.
- Once A completes task, A invokes the B definition.
  - Control is brought back to A in order to receive B's output.
