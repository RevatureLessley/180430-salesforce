  - variable hoisting
  - let, car, const

Closure:
  - encapsulating data in a function by returning a function and accessing the
  scope of the original function and calling the second function.
  - effectively creating private variables for functions

  add = function(x,y) {
	 if(!(y===undefined) {
      return  x + y;
   }
      return function(z) {
        return x + z;
      }
  }

Auto Invoking functions (not called this)
  - Immediately invoked functions


Abstracting:
  - hiding code complexity

Encapsulation:
  - Data hiding
  - Access restriction of data
  - fridge analogy
    - food for you
    - food for guests
    - food for your roommates
    - food for strangers?
  - Grouping data together and keeping
