              <p style="text-align:left">&nbsp; &nbsp; I started this little interest of mine in college, while i was going for my degree. I figure since i was learning
                  the software side of these things on my spare time i would also look into the hardware that went into computers. It was more like a mini project for me where
                  I learned all about the ins and outs of a computer. This is more like something i do on my spare time for fun, rather than make it out into a professional but
                  being knowledgeable about these stuff has been helpful for me.

              <p  style="text-align:left">&nbsp; &nbsp;I started playing Chess within my early teen years, I got really into the game of outwitting someone, chess was really
                  something that made you think about your actions, and every move had a consquences that can be felt. It was really interesting to play and watch
                  a chain reaction happened from moving your pieces around on the board. One flawed move could mean diaster for your entire field. It was really something
                  that got the brain flowing and going for me, and i felt calm and relax playing it.<p>

          <li >Piano:
              <img id="piano" src="Images/Piano.jpg" alt="Piano Hobby" />
              <p  style="text-align:left">&nbsp; &nbsp; I started self teaching myself piano at the age of 16, at first i was restricted to using the
                  digital online small piano's i could find surfing though the web. Eventually though i was able to obtain a full piano
                  for my use, I prefer a electric piano to a grand piano. Piano is just something fun i like to do on my spare time, playing the tunes to my favorite songs and
                  get your hand really working playing faster pace tempo songs. It's something that i still hope to do in the future
                  with my spare time, as i enjoy listening and playing to music.
