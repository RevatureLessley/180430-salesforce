					<h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
						<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
						typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
						industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
						when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
						scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
						survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
						into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
						unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
						release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
						passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
						software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
						Lorem Ipsum.</p>

					<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
						<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
						random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
						literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
						Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
						College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
						Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
						and going through the cites of the word in classical
						literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
						Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de
						Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
						Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
						treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
						the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
						ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
						1.10.32.</p>
						<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the
						1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
						1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
						by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original
						form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
						translation by H. Rackham.</p>

					<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
					<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be
					distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
					its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
					more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
					using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
					readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
					page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
					text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
					sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
					over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
					(injected humour and the like).</p>

					<h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
					<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum
					available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some
					form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't
					look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a
					passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
					anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the
					Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
					predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true
					generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200
					Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
					structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
					The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from
					repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words
					etc.</p>
