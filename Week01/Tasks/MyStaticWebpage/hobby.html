        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>My main hobby is <span class="boring">video games</span>, but that's <span class="boring">boring</span> to talk about. Instead, I'll talk about a more <span class="fun">fun</span> thing to talk about, <span class="fun">sand sculpture</span>.
        <br>
        I can say I started <span class="fun">sand sculpture</span> when I was in high school. My dad took me along the gigs and events he participated in along with our sand sculpture team <span class="fun">Archisand</span> since I was a little kid.
        <br>
        Needless to say, I didn't contribute much at first besides <span class="fun">wrecking</span> the sculpture after it was finished. However, over time I started contributing more and more.
        <br>
        Since <span class="fun">large-scale sand sculpture</span> requires metric tons of sand to be shoveled into forms, infused with water, and compacted, <span class="fun">child manual labor</span> was generally accepted with open arms.
        <br>
        Naturally, as an impoverished <span class="fun">child laborer</span>, I worked long hours of toiling in the sand with glee, knowing my efforts would fund my <span class="boring">video game</span> expenditures.
