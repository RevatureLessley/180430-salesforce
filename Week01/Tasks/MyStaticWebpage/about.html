        <p>My name is Matt Kostich, I was born July 21st 1992, I'm 25 years old, and a graduate of Southern Connecticut State University with a BA in Music. Along with my passion for music, I have a passion for programming and technology and I'm working hard to make a career
        as a developer!</p>
        <p>My interest in music started when I was young, in the 5th grade. I attended a music workshop for kids and wound up with a trumpet in my hands and I've been playing ever since.  My interest in programming started much later, in college. I was first exposed to it through an introduction to programming course (which was in VB).  From then on my desire to learn more grew and two years after I was doing web development for University's Office of Residence Life.</p>
        
        <p>For my cool link, I would like to share a resource that I've used numerous times over the years: <a href="http://imslp.org/">IMSLP</a>.  This site is an online library of scores, parts, and recordings for classicaly oriented musicians. </p>
        
        <p>In the interest of sharing some more about myself (and my passion for the music of dead white guys), below are some of my favorite composers and a little info about them!</p>
