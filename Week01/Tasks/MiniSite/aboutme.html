       <p>      I am a CS graduate currently in the employ of Revature, LLC.  How did I get here you may wonder? We'll skip the early years to save some time.  
        I was raised on a farm in Pennsylvania, doing manual labor of sorts during the summer, and had no computer access really until I was the age of 12. That was when
        the world of computers opened up for me. I quickly got into gaming at that point, and then started dabbling into programming as well for a free private server for a game called
        Ultima Online. Ultima Onlines' free server was programmed in C# and I started learning about scripting while trying different things out. I decided during high school to take computer courses, but since none were available at my high school,
        I ended up having to enroll in a vocational technical(VoTech) program for Computer Information Systems where I spent the first half of my day at another educational facility before returning for normal classes. I graduated from VoTech in 2005, then to help a friend, I traveled with
        a fair to the different shows across the east coast helping to set up and tear down rides, while running games during the actual fair hours. This took me on a trail from PA to Massacheusettes to Newyork and then many other stops on the way down to Florida.
        After returning, I got a job at a local target that was being opened soon, and decided to save money for college there. After 1.5 years, I said goodbye to my team and embarked on the journey to further my education.  This process, due to lifes interventions, 
        took me a total of 7 years to finally complete and receive my degree in Computer Information Systems, with a focus on Information Security. Afterwards, I got a job doing level 1 tech support to try and build some real work experience in the tech sector.  After 2.5 years, I saw a post for Revature hiring 20 Junior network
         administrators. Unfortunately, the positions filled instantly and none were remaining for me. I was then asked if I had any programming experience by a Revature recruiter, and they advised I go for this position. I did decently on the interview, was called back 
        the next day asking for me to come work for Revature, so I put in my 2 weeks notice right after the call.  1.5 weeks later, here I am, having met a great instructor and learning and brushing up on a lot of relevent technical skills. That is the short story of how I arrived here today.
