                    <h3> My favorite hobby is playing Trading Card Games.</h3>

                    <p> I started playing trading card games around the time Yu-gi-oh! got really popular and I haven’t stopped
                        since. I currently mainly play Pokemon and Hearthstone but I’ve also played YuGiOh and Cardfight
                        Vanguard for years. The reason I think it’s so easy to play card games for years is because the games
                        are always changing so they don’t really get stale. And also because of the many ways you can enjoy
                        card games whether it’s just collecting, building decks, playing with friends, or posting memes on
                        the internet about the developer’s poor game balancing. In preparing this presentation I think I’ve
                        managed to boil why I like card games down to 3 reasons
                    </p>
                    <p> For one, each card is a work of art that can be appreciated independent of the game. In pokemon specifically,
                        there are rare full art cards that cover the entire card and can individually be worth close to 100
                        dollars despite not giving you a single advantage in gameplay. The art really does a lot to sell
                        the vision of whatever deck you want to play.
                    </p>

                    <p> second reason is because It is really easy to make friends with people who play. For a shy person like
                        me it can be difficult to come up with a reason to interact with someone but at card shops where
                        they have weekly events and tournaments it’s easy to just walk up to someone and challenge them to
                        a game. Some of the closest friends I’ve made and maintained are through the friendly competition
                        that card games enable. The last reason it’s my favorite hobby is because playing card games are
                        a way to express yourself. Card games allow you to interact with opponents in interesting ways that
                        you don’t really get to in the real world. When you build a deck to play a game, you show your personality
                        through your decision to focus on a strategy to disrupt an opponent, or a strategy that focuses on
                        maintaining control of the game, or a strategy that focuses on setting up clutch plays. Each type
                        of deck gives a little insight into the kind of person you are. I personally enjoy high impact decks
                        that have combos that are difficult to pull off which might not always net me the win but are rewarding
                        if I can pull them off.
                    </p>
                    <p> There are a lot of hobbies that share some of the positives I’ve talked about but I feel like card games
                        have the perfect blend which earns them the spot as my favorite hobby.
