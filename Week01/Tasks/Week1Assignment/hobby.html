                        <h3> My favorite hobby is playing Trading Card Games.</h3>

                        <p> I started playing trading card games around the time Yu-gi-oh! got really popular and I haven’t stopped
                            since. I currently play Pokemon and Hearthstone but I’ve also played YuGiOh and Cardfight Vanguard
                            for years. The reason I think it’s so easy to play card games for so long is because each game
                            is always changing so it's hard for them to get stale. Its also easy to play for so long because
                            of the many ways you can enjoy card games: whether it’s just collecting, building decks, playing
                            with friends, or memeing on the internet about the poor game balancing.
                            <br> In preparing this presentation I think I’ve managed to boil why I like card games down to 3
                            reasons:
                        </p>

                        <ol>

                            <li class="dav-list">
                                <p> For one, each card is a work of art that can be appreciated independent of the game. In pokemon
                                    specifically, there are rare full art cards that cover the entire card and can individually
                                    be worth close to 100 dollars despite not giving you a single advantage in gameplay.
                                    The art really does a lot to sell the vision of whatever deck you want to play.
                                </p>

                                <img class="pull-right" src="assets/images/1150400.jpg" alt="Full art card" width="200px" height="auto">
                            </li>
                            <li class="dav-list">
                                <p> The second reason is because it is really easy to make friends with people who play. For a shy
                                    person like me it can be difficult to come up with a reason to interact with new people 
                                    but at card shops where they have weekly events and tournaments it’s easy to just walk
                                    up to someone and challenge them to a game. Some of the closest friends I’ve made and
                                    maintained are through the friendly competition that card games enable.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="dav-list">

                                <p> The last reason it’s my favorite hobby is because playing card games are a way to express
                                    yourself. Card games allow you to interact with opponents in interesting ways that you
                                    don’t really get to in the real world. When you build a deck to play a game, you show
                                    your personality through your decision to focus on a strategy to disrupt an opponent,
                                    or a strategy that focuses on maintaining control of the game, or a strategy that focuses
                                    on setting up clutch plays. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p> There are a lot of hobbies that share some of the positives I’ve talked about but I feel like card
                            games have the perfect blend which earns them the spot as my favorite hobby.
