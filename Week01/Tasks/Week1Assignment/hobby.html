        <h1>My favorite Hobby</h1>
        <p>
            What do I like to play?
                Pokemon, (Yugioh and Vanguard in the past)
            Why do I like to play?
                I like card games because they tend to have great card art
                I like to play card games because it is a form of expression

            What do I mean by display your personality?
                Card games allow you to interact with your opponent in interesting ways.
                Its not just about winning but how you approach the goal
                You show your personality by using decks that
                    - disrupt an opponent's strategy
                    - take control the state of the game
                    - or set up for clutch plays.
            
            I personaly like to go for big plays.
            High impact strategies that might not be the best for consistently winning but that
            can leave an opponent speechless if executed correctly.

            Another reason I like card games is because it makes it easy to make friends
            in real life. Visiting card shops is something anyone can do and they often do
            a good job of having weekly events where people can compete and grow together.
