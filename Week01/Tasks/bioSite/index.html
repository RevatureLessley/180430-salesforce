			<p>Welcome. It was no mere accident that you landed on this page. You've, of course, come here to learn about the great Arbiter Jérémy. It is told that long ago he masted the art of speech four times over. His tongue, honed at univeristy in English, French, Spanish, and Chinese, serves as his sword to slay those who come before him. Nary a man shall be left standing after the onslaught that is his logical prose. Such a sight his sleight of sense!
			</p>
			<p>
			His birth left a mark; it piqued the wonder of thousands in 1993 CE, and henceforth it seems yours as well. Shall we connect and prosper, or will you rue the thought of what could have been as you lay wasted, words about with fury and haste?
