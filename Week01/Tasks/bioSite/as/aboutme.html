			<p>Jeremy was born at 08:21 on 3rd June 1993; it was a Thursday. For his mother, it was a Thursday she would never forget.
			</p>
			<p>
			He started to find his way with computers around 13 when he took apart and put back together a computer. In his high school art class, he painted a picture of a motherboard. He decided to major in bioinformatics, and started working in desktop support. Later, he switched to studying French, but stayed in IT. Today he stands proud working minimum wage with a liberal arts degree.
