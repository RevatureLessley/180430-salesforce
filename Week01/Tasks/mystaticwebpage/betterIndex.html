			 all bootstrap elements are typically made to be inside of containers. Container class simply formats
			 the content within to be able to handle dynamic screen sizes, as well as force contents to more
			 aesthetically fit with the window size.
			 
			 Container encapsulates and allows formatting for a section of a page.
			 there are 2 types:
				"container"
					centers the container content, providing padding on the sides
				"container-fluid", which uses more real estate than the normal container
			NOTE: containers cannot be within other containers
