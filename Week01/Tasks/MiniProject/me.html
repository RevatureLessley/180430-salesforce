	<h2>I really like dad jokes. Here's a good one:

		<!-- 
			having this h3 nested within this h2 causes some issues.
			the browser places the <p> block below OUTSIDE of the <h2> tag here
			for some odd reason when this <h3> is within as well.
			this causes minor issues when using CSS selectors; specifically
			it messes with e1~e2 and e1 e2.

		<h3>Why is "dark" spelled with a "k" and not a "c"?</h3>

			<font size="2">Because you can't "c" in the dark.</font>
