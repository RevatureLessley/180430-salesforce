This Tasks folder in the Week01 folder contains all the necessary files for the first mini-project / assignment due Monday May 7th. 

There is a homepage describing what the webpage is.

There are hyperlinks to the following:
  aboutme.html - which is a biography page
  hobby.html - which lists my 2 favorite hobbies and information about them
  FizzBuzz.html - which is the Fizzbuzz assignment from Thursday May 3rd.
  Theme Song - The UGA fight song
  The Coppermind - The wiki for all things Brandon Sanderson which  fills the  requirement for a link to 
    a SFW website to discuss
    
Each of these pages that I designed has an accompanying .css or .js file.

The following required tags were used along with a few others:
  p
  table
  ul
  ol
  image
  
There are many instances of:
  inline CSS
  internal CSS
  external CSS
  
The three CSS selector types I used were: 
  > 
  a[href^="https"]
  ' ' //space
